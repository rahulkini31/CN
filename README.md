Computer Networks project: Grocery Store Program

This project is a grocery store program built on a client-server architecture, designed to demonstrate concepts in computer networks. The client-side interface allows users to browse, add, and purchase items, while the server handles requests, manages inventory, and processes transactions. This setup simulates real-world applications of networking, enabling a clear view of data exchange between client and server.
